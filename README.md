# Pokedex in Tkinter

## About
A simple Pokedex for Generation 1 Pokemons, written in Python and Tkinter

Run the program with `pokedex.py`

This program can also be expanded beyond the first 151 Pokemons from the generation 1. A download utility `download_util.py` script can be found under `data` folder. Simply change the variable `total_pokemon` to a number you wish to rebuild the pokemon database.
